Define the function `task_func` with parameters `x`, `y`, and `labels`.\n3. Create a figure and axis object using `plt.subplots()`.\n4. Iterate over the range of `x` (which is the same as the number of datasets in `y` and `labels`).\n5. For each dataset, calculate the mean (`mu`) and standard deviation (`std`) of the corresponding `y` data.\n6. Generate a range of `x` values using `np.linspace` to create a smooth curve for the PDF.\n7. Calculate the PDF values using `stats.norm.pdf` with the calculated `mu` and `std`.\n8. Plot the PDF on the axis with the corresponding label.\n9. Add a legend to the plot using `ax.legend()`.\n10. Return the created figure object.\n\nThe function is designed to visualize the PDFs of multiple datasets on a single plot,"
